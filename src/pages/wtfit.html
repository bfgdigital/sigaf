            <h2>The Philosophy: A "Fuel Gauge," Not a GPS</h2>
            <p>
                The Bitcoin protocol doesn't care about tweets, regulations,
                or media hype. Its forward march is relentless. The USD
                price is just a noisy, human interpretation of this
                progress. Standard charts are filled with patterns that
                demand interpretation, a process that is often subjective
                and error-prone.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>
                    This tool is an attempt to filter that noise. It's not a
                    chart for finding entry and exit points; it's a
                    <strong>"fuel gauge"</strong> for a quick, objective
                    reading of market momentum. It asks one question: "Is
                    the protocol's momentum, as measured by price, holding
                    up relative to its entire history?"
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Methodology: From Price to Pure Geometry</h2>
            <p>
                To provide an objective answer, we have to escape the
                distortions of absolute price and time. This model does so
                by converting Bitcoin's entire history into a single,
                normalized 1x1 geometric space.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Great Equalizer (Normalization):</strong>
                    Bitcoin's history is squashed into a 1x1 square. The
                    x-axis is its age in blocks (from 0% to 100%), and the
                    y-axis is its price relative to the All-Time High (from
                    0% to 100%). In this space, a price movement from 2013
                    can be directly compared to one from last week.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Benchmark (Macro Trend Angle):</strong> We
                    calculate the angle ($θ_{macro}$) of a straight line
                    from the origin (block 0, price $0) to the current
                    point. This single angle represents the average velocity
                    of Bitcoin's entire life.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Lenses (Micro Horizons):</strong> The tool
                    then calculates the angle for five recent timeframes, or
                    "horizons." Crucially, these aren't fixed periods (like
                    "90 days"). They are dynamically generated based on the
                    market's overall character.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Execution: How the Verdict Is Reached</h2>
            <p>
                The final verdict is a pure, unweighted consensus derived
                from comparing the micro to the macro.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Deriving Adaptive Horizons</h3>
            <p>
                The five analysis horizons are derived using a method
                inspired by signal processing to adapt to market conditions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A <strong>quadratic curve</strong> ($ax^2 + bx + c$) is
                    fitted to the entire normalized price history to measure
                    its overall acceleration or "curvature."
                </li>
                <li>
                    This curvature adjusts a formula used to find the peaks
                    of a theoretical <strong>chirp signal</strong>. This is
                    a signal whose frequency changes over time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the market is accelerating (a steepening curve), the
                    horizons spread out for a broad view. If it's
                    decelerating (a flattening curve), the horizons cluster
                    more recently for a high-resolution look at the present.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Calculating Deviation & Status</h3>
            <p>
                For each horizon, its momentum angle ($θ_{micro}$) is
                compared against the benchmark ($θ_{macro}$). The difference
                is its deviation ($Δ$).
            </p>
            <pre><code>Δ = θ_micro - θ_macro</code></pre>
            <p>
                The status (e.g.,
                <span class="sig-label sig-party">PARTY</span>,
                <span class="sig-label sig-no-bueno">NO BUENO</span>) is
                assigned based on how many standard deviations this delta is
                from the average of all five current deltas. This makes the
                signals inherently adaptive to recent volatility.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Reaching an Unweighted Consensus</h3>
            <p>
                Each horizon casts a "vote" from +2 to -2 based on its
                status. These votes are simply summed up. There is no
                complex weighting. This raw consensus determines the final
                "Yep..," "No.," or "Yeah Nah" verdict—a robust and
                straightforward assessment of whether the current momentum
                warrants your attention.
            </p>

            <h2>Visualizing The Geometry</h2>
            <p>
                While this tool avoids charts for its final analysis,
                visualizing the underlying geometry can be illuminating. The
                chart page demonstrates a core problem with subjective
                analysis: perspective changes everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will see the macro trend line, which looks steep from a
                distance, appear nearly flat when you zoom in on the present
                moment. This distortion is precisely why this meter was
                built—to replace subjective interpretation with objective
                calculation.
            </p>
