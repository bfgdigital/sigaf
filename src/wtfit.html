            <h2>The Philosophy: No Charts, No Interpretation</h2>
            <p>
                The Bitcoin protocol doesn't care about tweets, regulations,
                or media hype. Its forward march is relentless. The USD
                price is just a noisy, human interpretation of this
                progress. There are other metrics that would be great to use like
                the difficulty adjustments for eg, but, at the end of the day,
                people care about price.
            </p>
            <p>
                My beef is that standard charts are filled with patterns that
                demand interpretation, a process that is often subjective
                and error-prone. As a data guy, I look at a lot of charts
                and have come to realise you can bin 99% of them, you're probably
                not helping yourself by trying to interpret them.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>
                    This tool is an attempt to filter that noise. It's not a
                    tool for finding entry and exit points; it's a
                    <strong>"dashboard"</strong> for a quick, objective
                    reading of market momentum. It asks one question: "Is
                    the protocol's momentum, as measured by price, holding
                    up relative to its entire history?"
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Methodology: Make a box and measure angles</h2>
            <p>
                To provide an objective answer, we have to escape the
                distortions of absolute price and time. This model does so
                by converting Bitcoin's entire history into a single,
                normalized 1x1 geometric space.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>How does this help?</strong>
                    Bitcoin's history is fit into a 1x1 square. The
                    x-axis is its age in blocks (from 0 to the current block height), and the
                    y-axis is its price relative to the All-Time High (from
                    $0 to $ATH). In this space, a price movement from 2013
                    can be directly compared to one from last week.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Macro Trend Angle:</strong> We calculate the angle formed by a straight line from the
                    origin to the current price and block.
                    Our baseline (best-case scenario) is a 45º diagonal line from the origin that passes through the
                    all-time high (ATH). The deviation of our current trend angle from this 45º ideal is a key input
                    that tells the model about the health of the overall macro trend.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Micro Trend Horizons:</strong>
                    To measure momentum changes, we look backward from the current price to dynamically chosen points we
                    call "horizons." Unlike a fixed timeframe (e.g., "90 days"), these horizons are adaptively generated
                    based on the market's current character, ensuring we are always asking the most relevant questions.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Micro Measurement: A "Momentum of Momentum" Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                The final verdict is a weighted consensus that measures the market's acceleration or deceleration across
                different timeframes.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Deriving Adaptive Horizons</h3>
            <p>
                The analysis horizons are not fixed; they are generated using a method inspired by signal processing to
                adapt to market conditions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To identify the key “horizons” to measure price behavior, the model uses a "chirp" signal. The peaks
                    of this wave give us non-linear points in Bitcoin’s history to look back on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The shape of that chirp is calibrated by blending two macro signals: the **Quadratic Curvature** (is
                    the trend accelerating?) and the **Macro Angular Ratio** (is the trend healthy?).
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the macro trend is strong and decisive, the peaks are further apart, causing the model to sample
                    a **broad range of the past** (e.g., 3 weeks to 6 months) to understand the context of the large
                    move. If macro momentum is slowing, the peaks cluster toward the present, giving us a **tighter
                    lens** on recent volatility (e.g., 10 days to 80 days). This makes the model adapt to the market’s
                    tempo, not a rigid clock.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Calculating Corrected Momentum Deviation</h3>
            <p>
                This is the core of the analysis. Instead of just comparing a micro trend to the overall macro trend, we
                compare each timeframe's momentum to the next longest one in a sequential chain. This measures the *rate
                of change* of momentum.
            </p>
            <p>
                Crucially, this comparison is **corrected for the natural geometric distortion** that occurs when you
                "zoom in" on a trend line.
            </p>
            <pre><code>// Simplified Concept
Expected_Angle_S = Actual_Angle_L * (Lookback_S / Lookback_L)
Deviation = Actual_Angle_S - Expected_Angle_S</code></pre>

            <p>
                This process isolates the *true* acceleration or deceleration, giving a pure signal of whether momentum
                is building or fading relative to the established trend of the prior period. The status for each horizon
                (Peachy, No Bueno, etc.) is then assigned based on how significant this deviation is relative to the
                others.
            </p>

            <div class="status-definitions">
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="sig-label sig-party">PARTY</span>: Strong, unexpected positive acceleration ($Δ >
                        1.5σ$).</li>
                    <li><span class="sig-label sig-peachy">PEACHY</span>: Mild positive acceleration ($0.5σ < Δ \le
                            1.5σ$).</li>
                    <li><span class="sig-label sig-meh">MEH</span>: Momentum is behaving as expected ($-0.5σ \le Δ \le
                        0.5σ$).</li>
                    <li><span class="sig-label sig-watch">WATCH</span>: Mild negative acceleration (deceleration)
                        ($-1.5σ \le Δ < -0.5σ$).</li>
                    <li><span class="sig-label sig-no-bueno">NO BUENO</span>: Strong deceleration or trend breakdown ($Δ
                        < -1.5σ$).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>3. Reaching a Weighted Consensus</h3>
            <p>
                Each horizon casts a "vote" based on its status. However, these votes are not all equal. The consensus
                is **weighted to give more influence to longer-term signals**. This reflects a core philosophy: in a
                strong trend, the established, longer-term momentum is a more reliable signal than short-term, noisy
                volatility. This prevents a single bad day from overriding months of positive momentum, leading to a
                more robust and stable final verdict.
            </p>

            <h2>Visualizing The Geometry</h2>
            <p>
                While this tool avoids charts for its final analysis,
                visualizing the underlying geometry can help overcome my poor explanations.
                The chart page demonstrates a core problem with subjective
                analysis: perspective changes everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will see the macro trend line, which looks steep from a
                distance, appear nearly flat when you zoom in on the present
                moment. This distortion is precisely why this meter was
                built—to replace subjective interpretation with objective
                calculation.
            </p>
